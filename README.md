VectorCAST Coverage display plugin
==================================

This is a fork of the Emma-plugin; all existing components maintain the existing license. New files are licensed under MIT. Moved or renamed files maintain their old license, and their history can be seen by looking at the source control revision logs.

This is intended to be used with the VectorCAST-execution plugin.

Coverage information from tests runs that has been converted to XML files is read and displayed by this plugin. It shows coverage trends and allows drilling down to more detailed coverage informantion.
